## Docs

### Local Storage

This class provides static methods for interacting with the browser's local storage.

> The `LocalStorage` class imports `Local_Storage_Keys` from the **config** file. This import suggests that `Local_Storage_Keys` is an object containing key-value pairs for local storage keys.

The LocalStorage class includes three static methods:

- **set**: This method sets a value in the local storage by accepting a key and a value as parameters. It checks if the key exists in `Local_Storage_Keys`, and if so, it store the value as a JSON string.

- **get**: This method retrieves a value from the local storage based on a given key. If the key exists in `Local_Storage_Keys`, it retrieve the value. If the value is null, it returns the defaultValue (if provided), otherwise it returns **null**. It also handles parsing errors and logs them to the console.

- **remove**: This method removes an item from the local storage based on a given key. It checks if the key exists in `Local_Storage_Keys` and remove the corresponding item.

This codebase provides a convenient way to interact with the browser's local storage by encapsulating the logic within a class and providing static methods for common operations like setting, getting, and removing values from the local storage.

### API

This class encapsulates an Axios instance for making API requests to a server using the Axios library.

> The `axios` module and `AxiosInstance` type are imported from the 'axios' package. The `SERVER_URL` constant is imported from the 'config' file. The `LOCAL_STORAGE` object is imported from the 'localStorage' file, and the `routes` object is imported from the 'routes' file.

The class includes several methods for making specific API requests. These methods use the Axios instance to send requests and return the response data. The methods are named after the corresponding API endpoints and accept optional request bodies or query parameters.
